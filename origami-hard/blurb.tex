The tree method is an algorithm developed by Robert Lang which designs
an origami base with a collection of flaps which are arranged so that
their projection to the ground is an optimally scaled copy of a
specified metric tree. These flaps can then be molded to transform the
base into something more artistic (see \url{www.langorigami.com} to be flabbergasted).

The example here is a base designed by the tree method with nine flaps
and projection a star graph. I've kept it simple and unartistic
because origami is hard for me. But that's not my fault: the origami
design problem solved by the tree method is NP-hard!
