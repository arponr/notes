\section*{Introduction}

These are the notes I have taken in my independent study of \textit{Calculus} by Michael Spivak, which I've worked through to rigourise my knowledge of basic calculus and to gain experience in proof-writing and such. The first few chapters were largely review (and were my first steps into rigourous mathematics and note-taking), and so the notes are informal and less detailed than in later chapters. Each chapter is split into my notes, a summary of what I thought was important (and new to me, in some way) and then the solutions to a few of the exercises I have completed.
