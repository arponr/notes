\section*{Introduction}

The first eight chapters of these notes were assembled by the three authors in their independent study of multivariable calculus as a part of their IB Senior Project. The rest was assembled by the first author for his own (admittedly strange form of) pleasure. Any mistakes are assuredly at the fault of the author(s).

The entirety of these notes are based on the lectures for 18.02 on MIT OpenCourseWare, given by Denis Auroux, and serves to be a resource for those learning the subject in the future. 

In the course of taking these notes, the author realised that many examples included require a geometric or visual diagram, which could not be included in these notes. He thus pleads that anyone silly enough to use these notes as a tool to try and create these diagrams on their own using the written descriptions, or to refer directly to MIT OpenCourseWare.
