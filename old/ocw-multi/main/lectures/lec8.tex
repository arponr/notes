\section{Partial differential equations}

Partial differential equations are equations involving the partial derivatives of an unknown function.

The heat equation is the partial differential equation:
\[ \pd{f}{t} = k\left(\pdn{f}{x}{2} + \pdn{f}{y}{2} + \pdn{f}{z}{2}\right), \]
where $f$ is a function of four variables---$x,y,z,t$---that describes temperature at a point in spacetime. So this tells us how temperature changes over time given an intial distribution (and a closed system).

Solving differential equations of even one variable is difficult (in general), so we won't go into solving things like the heat equation. This just gives us a practical motivation for using the partial derivative.
