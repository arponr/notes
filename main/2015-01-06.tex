I'm trying to understand why Morava E-theory $E(n)$ is
$K(n)$-local. Unsurprisingly this means I should go back and try to
actually understand what $E(n)$ really is, especially since in the
writing out there the term ``Morava E-theory'' describes a couple of
distinct (but of course quite related) objects.

\begin{lemma}
  \zlabel{hithere}
  $E(n)$ is the $K(n)$-localization of Johnson-Wilson theory.
\end{lemma}
