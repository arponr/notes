We set out from someplace quite classical: the representation theory
of finite groups, in particular the theory of characters
therein. Let's briefly recall how this story goes. Let $G$ be a finite
group. The goal of character theory is to understand a representation
$\rho \c G \to \Aut(V)$ of $G$ on a complex vector space $V$ via its
associated \emph{character}: the function
\begin{equation}
  \label{classical-character}
  \chi_\rho \ce {\tr} \circ \rho \c G \to \lC,
\end{equation}
where $\tr$ denotes the trace map. The beauty of character theory is
that it accomplishes this goal quite thoroughly. This fact can be
articulated succinctly as follows.

\begin{definitions}
  \label{classical-character-dfns}
  \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Consider the collection of isomorphism classes of complex
    representations of $G$, which forms a commutative semiring under
    the operations of direct sum and tensor product; the Grothendieck
    ring of this semiring, i.e. the commutative ring obtained by
    formally adjoining additive inverses, is denoted $\Rep(G)$ and
    referred to as the \emph{representation ring} of $G$.
  \item A function on $G$ is called a \emph{class function} if it is
    conjugation-invariant. Let $\Cl(G;\lC)$ denote the $\lC$-algebra
    of class functions $G \to \lC$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definitions}

\begin{theorem}[Classical character theory]
  \label{classical-character-thm}
  The assignment $\rho \mapsto \chi_\rho$ defined in
  \cref{classical-character} determines a ring homomorphism
  $\Rep(G) \to \Cl(G;\lC)$, which furthermore induces an isomorphism
  \[
  \lC \otimes_\lZ \Rep(G) \isoto \Cl(G;\lC)
  \]
  of $\lC$-algebras.
\end{theorem}

The goal of the this thesis is to explain a generalization of this
classical character theory, which begins to suggest itself when we
view \cref{classical-character-thm} as a statement in homotopy theory.
