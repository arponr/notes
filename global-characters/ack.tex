\section*{Acknowledgements}


\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Let me first thank my advisor, Jacob Lurie. He has been
  incredibly generous with his time, and has pointed me towards and
  clearly explained to me a great deal of fascinating mathematics,
  which is why I was able to write this thesis.

\item The Harvard math department has been a wonderful place to be,
  and thanks are due to all of my professors. Math 55 changed my whole
  life, so thanks to Prof. Yum-Tong Siu and my excellent classmates
  and course assistant. Thanks also to Emily Riehl for supervising an
  absolutely fantastic reading course.

\item Of course, I've learned the most from my friends. I'd like to
  especially thank two of them: Allen Yuan, for loving algebraic
  topology alongside me, and for reading over bits of this thesis; and
  Alex Makelov, for being absurd in all of the best senses of the
  word, and for pretty much constantly giving me things to think and
  be excited about.

\item But most of all, this thesis is for my family, in particular my
  parents. I and all the opportunies I have had are products of their
  sacrifice, love, and devotion. Thank you.
\end{itemize}
